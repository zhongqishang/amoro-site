      <description>Table Configurations Multi-level configuration management Amoro provides configurations that can be configured at the Catalog, Table, and Engine levels. The configuration priority is given first to the Engine, followed by the Table, and finally by the Catalog.&#xA;Catalog: Generally, we recommend users to set default values for tables through the Catalog properties configuration, such as Self-optimizing related configurations. Table: We also recommend users to specify customized configurations when Create Table, which can also be modified through Alter Table operations.</description>
